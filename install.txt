Family Resource Program Setup - April 4, 2013
---------------------------------------------

This document outlines the steps to setup the Family Resource Program software on your server. 
 
For this setup document we assume you are either using Centos (Fedora) or Ubuntu. 
However, this software should work on any operating that supports Zend, PHP, MySQL, and Apache.

Please ensure that you have installed the following on your server.

1. Apache

Install
---------

	Centos
	sudo yum install httpd

	Ubuntu
	sudo apt-get install apache2

Configure 
---------

You will want to set up an Apache virtual host to hold this site. Here's an example. Take notice of the rewrite rules in particular
as the zend framework depends upon rewriting to function.

Modify this example to suit your domain and directory structure and copy it into your Virtual Host config file 
in your Apache installation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@cpsc319.tk
    ServerName domainname.ca
    ServerAlias wwww.domainname.ca
    DocumentRoot /var/vhosts/frp/public/
    ErrorLog /var/vhosts/frp/logs/error.log
    CustomLog /var/vhosts/frp/logs/access.log combined

<Directory "/var/vhosts/frp/public">
       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride All
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
   </Directory>

</VirtualHost>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now start the server.

	Centos
	sudo service httpd start

	Ubuntu 
	sudo service apache2 start

2. PHP
-------
Install
	Centos
	sudo yum install php

	Ubuntu
	sudo apt-get install php

3. MySQL
--------
Install
	
	Centos
	sudo yum install mysql-server

	Ubuntu
	sudo apt-get install mysql-server


4. The Zend Framework
---------------------
Install

We have developed the system based on Zend framework version 1.12.

	Centos
	sudo yum install php-ZendFramework	

	Ubuntu
	sudo apt-get install zend-framework


5. Clone FRP files into your virtual host diretory
--------------------------------------------------
In our example we located our files at /var/vhosts/frp/. Please clone the FRP files into this directory or whatever directory
you specified in step 1. Please make sure that the tmp directory under /var/vhosts/frp/ is writeable by Apache.


6. Run setup.sh from the frp directory
---------------------------------------
This script will configure the application and build the database tables. Run from your shell by navigating to the directory
where you unpacked the frp files in step 5. Type ./setup.sh and run. 

7. Setup cron jobs
__________________

There are cron jobs that are required for email sending and daily housekeeping tasks.

Make sure cron is running by typing:

service crond start

Now edit the cron files with

sudo crontab -e

Add these following lines to your crontab. Please change the paths to reflect the directory structure of where you installed FRP.

# Runs every minute for bulk mail sending
*/1 * * * * /var/vhosts/frp/cron/mail.php
# Runs once a day at midnight for daily housekeeping tasks
00 00 * * * /var/vhosts/frp/cron/daily.php
